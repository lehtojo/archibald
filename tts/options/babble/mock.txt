See that there, sonny? That's a catfish hole. They love the deep water, the shadows.  You gotta use a stink bait for them, something with a real good pong to it. Chicken livers, maybe some cut bait. Let it sink to the bottom, then just twitch it a little. Catfish are lazy, but they can't resist a good stink and an easy meal.

Now, bass, they're a different story.  They like the structure, the edges of the weeds, the fallen logs. You gotta cast right up next to it, let the lure sink a bit, then give it a good jerk. Bass are ambush predators, they'll hit it hard if they think it's a wounded baitfish. Use a spinnerbait, maybe a crankbait, something with a lot of flash and vibration.

And bluegill, they're fun for the little ones. A simple worm on a hook under a bobber, that's all you need. They'll bite all day long, good practice for the young'uns.

The most important thing, though, is to be patient. Fishing ain't about catching, it's about being out here, enjoying the quiet, the sunshine, the breeze. It's about the stories, the memories. That's the real catch, sonny, the time spent together.
